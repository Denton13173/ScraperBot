# Personalized Step-by-Step Development Plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Tooling
1. **Install Prerequisites**
   - Python (latest recommended version).
   - Git and VS Code (with CoPilot enabled).
   - (Optional) Docker if you plan to containerize later.

**How to Do It:**
1. Download & run the Python installer (e.g., python.org).
2. Visit git-scm.com to install Git. Initialize a Git repository in the project folder.
3. In VS Code, enable Copilot from Extensions and sign in with GitHub.
4. Create your virtual environment and install libraries using `pip install`.

2. **Virtual Environment**
   - Create and activate `bot_env`:
     ```bash
     python -m venv bot_env
     bot_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
     source bot_env/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
     ```

3. **Dependency Installation**
   - `discord.py` for Discord interactions.
   - `python-dotenv` for environment variable management.
   - `pyautogui` for automating text commands.
   - `tkinter` for GUI features (optional, included with most Python installations).
   - Additional libraries will be added later as needed.

4. **Version Control & Auto-Push**
   - Initialize a local Git repository.
   - Create `git_auto_push.bat` to stage, commit, and push changes:
     ```bat
     @echo off
     git add .
     git commit -m "Auto commit"
     git push
     ```
   - Schedule this script to run every 5 minutes via Task Scheduler or a cron job.

### Check Function
- Verify Python, Git, and VS Code installations by running simple commands (`python --version`, `git --version`).
- Confirm virtual environment activation and library installs with `pip list`.
- Ensure Copilot is responding by creating a simple test file and letting Copilot suggest completions.

## Phase 2: Bot Configuration & Basic Setup
1. **Discord Developer Portal**
   - Create an application, add a bot, and invite it to your server.
   - Set permissions to allow for reading messages and message content.

**How to Do It:**
1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal -> Applications -> “New Application.”
2. Enable “Message Content Intent” in the bot section.
3. Store `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`; access it via `dotenv.load_dotenv()`.
4. Use `client = discord.Client(intents=...)` in `import discord1.py`.

2. **Create `.env` File**
   - Store your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` without exposing it in Git history.
   - Load with `python-dotenv` in your main script.

3. **Basic Connection Code**
   - Write a script (e.g., `import discord1.py`) to authenticate and log in.
   - Use `ISTheBotInTheServer.py` to confirm the bot’s presence in your test server.
   - Print a console message upon successful login.

### Check Function
- Confirm the bot’s online status by running the login script.
- Validate that `.env` is loaded correctly by printing `os.getenv("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN")` (no actual token displayed).
- Observe the console message for “Logged in as [Bot Name].”

## Phase 3: Message Monitoring & Deal Extraction
1. **Message Parsing**
   - In `import discord1.py`, listen for new messages.
   - Identify potential deal messages by looking for keywords (e.g., “deal”, “SKU”).
   - Extract SKU, discount, and price data.

**How to Do It:**
1. Listen for events: `@client.event async def on_message(message): ...`
2. Use string operations or regex to parse SKUs and discounts.
3. Cache valid deals in Python structures (dicts/lists).

2. **Data Validation**
   - Check if the message originates from supported channels.
   - Validate numeric fields (e.g., ensure discount is within 0%–100%).

3. **Storage of Extracted Deals**
   - Store deals in an in-memory data structure (lists, dictionaries).
   - Plan for potential migration to a database in a later phase.

### Check Function
- Post a test “deal” message in your Discord server; verify console/log output for SKU, discount, and price.
- Attempt invalid messages; ensure they are not falsely identified as deals.
- Print stored deals to confirm correct data parsing.

## Phase 4: User Interactivity & Command Handling
1. **ZIP Code Management**
   - Implement `!setzip` and `!checkzip` commands:
     - Save the user’s ZIP in a user preferences structure.
     - Return the current ZIP on request.
   - Extend this approach for other user-specific settings (e.g., store preferences).

**How to Do It:**
1. Use command prefixes, e.g., `!setzip` or `!checkzip`.
2. Maintain a global or class-based dictionary with user IDs and settings.
3. Validate inputs (ZIP format) and respond with success/failure messages.

2. **Filtering Mechanisms**
   - Filter deals by store, ZIP code relevance, and discount threshold.
   - Provide user commands to set filters dynamically.

3. **Real-Time Notifications**
   - Send alerts when a high-interest deal is found (e.g., discount > 70%).
   - Integrate scheduling to periodically check for updated prices.

### Check Function
- Use `!setzip 12345` to set a ZIP code, then `!checkzip` to confirm.
- Confirm filtering logic by testing different discount thresholds and ZIP codes.
- Inspect logs or console to ensure correct command execution.

## Phase 5: Automated Forwarding & Category Management
1. **Channel Forwarding**
   - Automatically forward valid deals to a designated “Deals” channel using `allstores70.py`.
   - Use `dealadd.py` to add deals with PyAutoGUI if needed.

**How to Do It:**
1. Use PyAutoGUI for typing commands into Discord if direct API usage is limited.
2. Check if the channel exists; if not, create it automatically with the Discord API.
3. Match deals to categories with a simple rule-based filter (keywords, discount range).

2. **New Channel Creation**
   - If the deals channel doesn’t exist, use `DealsCreation.py` to create it automatically.

3. **Categorization**
   - Apply scripts like `HIfilters.py` and `homeprovementfilterbot.py` for structured sorting.
   - Group deals into categories (e.g., home improvement, hardware, tools).

4. **Stock Summaries**
   - Schedule daily stock summaries to each relevant Discord channel.
   - Store historical data briefly, then purge records to keep memory usage low.

### Check Function
- Trigger an event that should forward a deal. Confirm it appears in the designated channel.
- Verify new channel creation if none exists.
- Check that categories (e.g., tools vs. furniture) are assigned correctly based on filtering scripts.

## Phase 6: Advanced AI Features
1. **NLP & Fuzzy Matching**
   - Implement advanced text parsing for more accurate deal detection:
     - Use fuzzy matching to catch partial matches (e.g., “Dewalt drill” ~ “DeWALT Drill”).
   - Expand NLP capabilities for more context-based alerts.

**How to Do It:**
1. Implement fuzzy matching (e.g., `fuzzywuzzy` library) for partial text matches.
2. Assign scores to deals based on discount, brand popularity, user interest.
3. For persistent data, set up a simple SQLite or PostgreSQL database.

2. **AI-Based Prioritization**
   - Introduce a scoring system to highlight top-value deals.
   - Potentially integrate a machine learning model to learn user preferences over time.

3. **Persistent Data Storage**
   - Migrate user data (ZIP codes, store preferences) to a database.
   - Ensure the bot can restart without losing preferences or historical deal data.

### Check Function
- Manually test a fuzzy search scenario (e.g., “dril” vs. “drill”). Verify partial matches.
- Inspect assigned scores or priority levels for deals.
- Validate that data persists (or is prepared for persistence) in a chosen database.

## Phase 7: Deployment & Continuous Operation
1. **Cloud Hosting**
   - Containerize code (optional) or deploy directly to Heroku, AWS, or another provider.
   - Configure environment variables in the cloud environment.

**How to Do It:**
1. Choose a platform (Heroku/AWS/other) and configure environment variables there.
2. Log major events and errors for troubleshooting using Python’s `logging` module.
3. Keep documentation updated in `README.md` and record changes in `Changelog.md`.

2. **Logging & Error Tracking**
   - Set up logging for debug info and error handling.

3. **Documentation & Changelog**
   - Update `README.md` with setup steps, usage instructions.
   - Maintain `Changelog.md` to track each feature and bug fix.

### Check Function
- Deploy to chosen platform (e.g., Heroku) and ensure bot remains online.
- Test environment-specific variables (logs, error handling).
- Review the updated `Changelog.md` to confirm each deployment step is documented.

## Phase 8: Public Release & Maintenance
1. **User Onboarding & Guides**
   - Document common commands, customization options, and advanced features.
   - Provide troubleshooting steps.

**How to Do It:**
1. Provide new server owners with instructions for adding your bot.
2. Continuously refine filters, commands, and notifications based on feedback.
3. Use Git auto-push or a CI/CD pipeline to deploy enhancements regularly.

2. **Scheduled Updates**
   - Continue to refine the NLP logic, add more store integrations, and enhance user personalization.
   - Keep using GitHub auto-push or a CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration.

### Check Function
- Attempt adding the bot to a fresh Discord server using invite links or instructions in the README.
- Validate that all major features (commands, deals, filters) still work in a new environment.
- Confirm automated updates (Git auto-push, CI/CD) occur without issues.

## Phase 9: Dynamic Self-Learning & Enhanced Intelligence
1. **Data Gathering & Analysis**
   - Location: A new module (e.g., `self_learning.py`) that logs user interactions, frequently accessed deals, and user feedback.
   - Approach: Collect data on which deals users click or respond to, storing results in a database. Ensure anonymized or minimal personally identifiable storage.
   - Most Robust Method: Use a time-stamped approach to track each event, allowing for easy trend analysis.

2. **Behavioral Modeling**
   - Location: Within `self_learning.py` or a dedicated sub-folder for AI scripts.
   - Approach: Apply machine learning (ML) algorithms (e.g., scikit-learn or TensorFlow) to predict user interests based on past interactions.
   - Most Robust Method: Continually retrain the model on newly gathered data, storing models in versioned formats (e.g., joblib or PMML).

3. **Automated Tuning & Feedback Loops**
   - Location: Integration across core bot scripts (deal extraction, user commands) to adjust thresholds dynamically.
   - Approach: Let the bot automatically tweak discount thresholds or recommended deals as it gains data on user behavior.
   - Most Robust Method: Keep a fallback for manual overrides if the ML model becomes skewed. Provide an admin command to reset or retrain.

4. **Evolving Command & Conversation Handling**
   - Location: Possibly integrate advanced NLP libraries, such as spaCy or transformers, to interpret user requests beyond simple commands.
   - Approach: Extend `on_message` or add slash commands to interpret user queries (e.g., “Find me the best deals for a lawn mower under $200”).
   - Most Robust Method: Use a pre-trained language model, fine-tuned on domain-specific phrases, for more natural conversation-like interactions.

5. **SysOps & Monitoring**
   - Location: Additional debug/logging modules tied to each self-learning step.
   - Approach: Collect, store, and visualize metrics (e.g., error rates, user engagement) in real-time dashboards.
   - Most Robust Method: Use an external monitoring service (Datadog, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch) for deeper insights and anomaly detection.

### Check Function
- After implementing each sub-step, run tests to confirm data is being recorded.
- Inspect ML model predictions (e.g., output top 3 “best-matched deals” to confirm logic).
- Verify the bot can handle new requests accurately and that any auto-tuning doesn’t disrupt existing features.

## Additional Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Small & Test Often**
   - Break major features into tiny tasks (e.g., extracting price, discount, etc.).
   - Commit and push each working micro-feature for easy rollback if something breaks.

2. **Use Branches for Bigger Features**
   - Create a new Git branch (e.g., `feature/home-improvement-filters`) whenever adding significant functionality.
   - Merge into main only when stable, ensuring the main branch remains reliable.

3. **Embrace Logging & Debugging Early**
   - Use Python’s `logging` module for granular status messages and error reporting.
   - Wrap message-processing or critical operations in `try-except` blocks to log unexpected errors.

4. **Maintain a Clear Configuration**
   - Keep all configuration values (store names, discount ranges, PyAutoGUI coordinates) in a single config file or dictionary.
   - Update one place to change settings across your entire bot.

5. **Keep the .env File Organized**
   - Consistent variable naming: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DB_HOST`, etc.
   - Document each environment variable’s purpose in a README or config doc.
   - Never hardcode sensitive info; ensure secrets stay out of source control.

6. **Incremental GUI Additions**
   - Start with a minimal GUI (e.g., “Start”/”Stop”) before adding advanced controls.
   - Test each new button or feature as you add it, preserving previously stable code.

7. **Write a Quickstart or “How to Run” Section**
   - Summarize essential setup steps in your README.md (e.g., installing Python, configuring .env).
   - Provide usage examples so new collaborators can start quickly without confusion.

8. **Test with a Private Discord Server & Dedicated Channel**
   - Keep testing spam contained in a dedicated channel.
   - Consider a secondary test account for user-based testing (commands, role-based actions).

9. **Document as You Go**
   - Insert short inline comments where needed.
   - Update the Changelog for each bug fix or feature addition.
   - Use a wiki or extra .md files if the project grows beyond basic documentation.

10. **Don’t Reinvent the Wheel**
   - Rely on Copilot or references from existing Discord bots for routine tasks.
   - Reuse standard design patterns (e.g., event-driven message handling, slash commands) to avoid duplicating efforts.

**Key Takeaway**  
Working incrementally, committing frequently, and maintaining clean configuration/logs will help you quickly identify and fix problems before they escalate. Incorporate each guideline alongside the phases of your development plan to ensure a stable, efficient ScraperBot.

## Summary
This expanded plan guides you from initial setup to advanced AI features. Follow each phase in order, ensuring stable incremental growth. Use CoPilot to assist with coding each step, and confirm functionality through testing before moving on.
